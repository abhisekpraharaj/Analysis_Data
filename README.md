# Analysis_Data
In this repository, I've documented essential analysis procedures commonly employed in High Energy Physics research. The focus of my work has been on examining data from Au-Au collisions at 200 GeV. I've undertaken several critical tasks, including the generation of spectra for particle kaons and an in-depth exploration of their behavior across various centrality levels. Additionally, I've employed the invariant mass method to extract the Invariant Yield of Phi-Mesons within a specific centrality range. Please note that the code is a work in progress, and if you have any inquiries or uncertainties about the analysis process, don't hesitate to reach out for clarification or assistance.
